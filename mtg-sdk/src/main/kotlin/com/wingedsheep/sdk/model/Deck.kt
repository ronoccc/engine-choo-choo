 * Represents a deck of Magic cards for game initialization.

 * instantiated into entity IDs when the game starts.
 *
 * ## Usage
 * ```kotlin
 * val deck = Deck(
 *     cards = listOf("Mountain", "Mountain", "Lightning Bolt", "Goblin Guide", ...)
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * The engine uses the [CardDefinition.name] to look up card definitions from
 * registered card sets.
 *
 * ## Multi-printing
 * The legacy [cards] field carries names only; pass [cardEntries] instead (or alongside) to
 * pin specific printings. When [cardEntries] is non-empty it is authoritative; the engine
 * derives names from it. When only [cards] is supplied (the historical case) the deck
 * behaves exactly as before. Helpers like [countOf] and [uniqueCards] always operate on
 * names so deck-construction rules (4-of, singleton, banlists) collapse identically across
 * different printings of the same card.
