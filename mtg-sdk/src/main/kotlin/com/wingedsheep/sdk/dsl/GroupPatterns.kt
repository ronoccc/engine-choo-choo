     * [power] and [toughness] are snapshotted into pipeline `storedNumbers` immediately before
     * the (also snapshotted, see [IterationSpace.Group]) group pass, so every iteration's
     * [ModifyStatsEffect] reads back the same frozen [DynamicAmount.VariableReference] instead
     * of resolving [power]/[toughness] again.
     *
     * Deliberately distinct from [doublePowerAndToughnessForAll], whose amount
     * (`EntityReference.IterationEntity`) is *supposed* to differ per iteration — each creature
     * doubles its *own* power, not a group-wide reading. Freezing that one would take whichever
     * entity is processed first and hand its power to everyone else, which is wrong in the
     * opposite direction. Use this function only for a genuinely group-wide X; keep a per-entity
