/**
 * Overwhelming Stampede — Magic 2011 #189 (canonical printing)
 * {3}{G}{G}
 * Sorcery
 *
 * Until end of turn, creatures you control gain trample and get +X/+X, where X is the greatest
 * power among creatures you control.
 *
 * X is checked once, as the spell resolves (CR 611.2c) — the printed ruling gives a worked
 * example: with creatures at 2/1, 2/2, 2/4, 4/1, 5/5 and 5/6, every one of them gets +5/+5
 * (the greatest power among them, 5, seen once) rather than a value that climbs as earlier
 * creatures in some iteration order are pumped first. [Patterns.Group.pumpAndGrantToAll]'s
 * `DynamicAmount` overload freezes that reading into pipeline `storedNumbers` before applying
 * it to the (also snapshotted) group, so every creature you control gets the same bonus and a
 * creature that enters afterward gets nothing.
