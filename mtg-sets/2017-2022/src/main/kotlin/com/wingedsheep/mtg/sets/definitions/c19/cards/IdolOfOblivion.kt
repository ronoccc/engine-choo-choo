/**
 * Idol of Oblivion — Commander 2019 #55 (canonical printing)
 * {2} · Artifact
 *
 * {T}: Draw a card. Activate only if you created a token this turn.
 * {8}, {T}, Sacrifice this artifact: Create a 10/10 colorless Eldrazi creature token.
 *
 * The draw ability's gate is the new `TurnTracker.TOKENS_CREATED` turn tracker —
 * [Conditions.YouCreatedATokenThisTurn] — read at activation time, not at resolution: the
 * printed ruling confirms the ability stays activatable even if the created token has since left
 * the battlefield, or was created before this permanent entered, which is exactly what a turn-
 * history log (rather than a live board count) gives for free.
