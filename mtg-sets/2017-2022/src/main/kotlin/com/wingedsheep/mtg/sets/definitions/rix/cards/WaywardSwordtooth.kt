/**
 * Wayward Swordtooth
 * {2}{G}
 * Creature — Dinosaur
 * Ascend (If you control ten or more permanents, you get the city's blessing for the rest of
 * the game.)
 * You may play an additional land on each of your turns.
 * This creature can't attack or block unless you have the city's blessing.
 *
 * Ascend is state-based-action-driven off the printed [Keyword.ASCEND] alone (see
 * TendershootDryad) — no manual trigger needed. The land-drop grant is
 * [GrantAdditionalLandDrop]; the attack/block gate reads the same
 * [Conditions.YouHaveCitysBlessing] that ascend's SBA sets.
